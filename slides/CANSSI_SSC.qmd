## Introduction

- `RMarkdown` is a powerful tool to create reproducible papers
- However, R is rarely used in the life sciences as a default method to create papers
- \color{red}{Why?}

## Reasons

- "R is just for Stats"
- "There is a learning curve"
- **"I can't create figures for publication"**


## The Problem

- Papers in the life sciences usually require figures where the following are combined:
    - Images from cells/tissues
    - Figures that summarize data
    - Figures that present statistical analyses (with "p-values")
    
## The Problem

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{A typical figure}
\copyrightbox[b]{\includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{figure.jpg}}
                {\tiny{Guerra et al.} \textit{Neoplasia} \textbf{2021}}
    \end{figure}

- \color{red}{Can figures like this be created using `RMarkdown`?}
